Before you begin
****************

This tutorial assumes you have installed |CL| on your host system.
For detailed instructions on installing |CL| on a bare metal system, visit
our :ref:`bare metal installation guide <bare-metal-install-desktop>`.

Install Flatpak on your host system
===================================

Flatpak is included as part of the bundle `desktop`. To install the
application, log in to your user account and enter the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

   sudo swupd bundle-add desktop

Install and run the LibreOffice Flatpak image
=============================================

Application developers have the option to bundle their applications using
Flatpak to allow the installation of a single distribution of their
application on different distributions of Linux, including |CL|.
Flatpak provides a `list of applications`_ available through Flathub.

|CL| enables the Flathub repository by default.


Installing using gnome software
-------------------------------

All you need to do is to launch `gnome software`, search for the LibreOffice
app, and click the install button.
